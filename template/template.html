            <p class="title wrapper">Blades</p>
                <p class="text paragraph">Blades come in many shapes. Most are hardened warriors, proficient with the sword or bow, or magicians and witches, maleficar priests, even fairborn. Some Blades hide in plain sight, maintaining safehouses and collecting information. They are the hands of the Trickster, goddess of Magic and Whimsy, and thus the cause of the Lord Reaper's divine wrath.<br><br> Formed during the fourth Reaping by an unknown Patron Fairy, Blades have proven themselves determined to fight back Horrors ever since. No one knows exactly how a Blade is inducted, or how they stay in touch, but most things Blade involve Trickster magics. Their very presence draws in sprites, and lesser fairies spring up wherever a Blade lingers. While that means Blades collaborate with forces that ought to be left alone—forces which may well have caused the Reapings to begin with—they are a relief in times of Reaping. Many Horrors resist defeat by ordinary means, and often only Blades know how to put them to rest. Most Blades travel alone or in small groups, moving from town to town to collect bounties or intercede in conflicts between mortals and the fair folk. Once every four years, they are said to have great gatherings in dark forests, deep beneath the earth, or in hidden safehouses at the very heart of civilization. What they discuss there is unknown. Perhaps they drink the blood of virgins to keep their powers, perhaps they cast foul magics to ensnare their enemies. Perhaps the very Trickster is summoned, and they dance with her beneath the moonlight.</p>

                <p class="subtitle wrapper">Known powers</p>
                <p class=text>Blades are said to be able to do many things. Some of these are hearsay, certainly, but people say Blades can conjure sprites into existence, that they can force those who are unfaithful to the Lord Reaper into unwanted fairy promises and curses. </p>
                <p class="text">Some are said to be immortal, that they are each granted a boon by the Trickster Goddess.Many cannot willingly lie for fear of death. It is said that if one steals a Blade’s weapon, they lose their powers forever.</p>
                <p class="subtitle wrapper">Blades in the minds of regular people</p>
                <p class=text>Blades are a relatively new profession, perhaps only three centuries old. In times of Reaping season, a Blade is a uneasy ally. A lesser evil. In times of peace, one does well to steer clear. Fairies are dangerous, after all. Anyone who deals with them might well lead you into a curse with them. In folklore, however, Blades inspire many epics and ballads. Bards and performance troupes may—when out of earshot of a Justiciar priest—sing songs of legendary Blade heroes, such as Lodewick the Fair, the first and greatest Blade to grace Fallowmere:</p>
                <p class="poem center">Borne from snowy dales and bluest frost,<br>
                he bears a wolfskin cloak to silver his shoulders,<br>
                wielding Volmyr, ancient steel&mdash;now lost&mdash;<br>
                but in his hands it did burn and smoulder.</p>

            <div class="column">
                <p class="text">In song, Lodewick has lived a hundred different lives and deaths since his passing over three hundred years ago. The best known iteration in Berningen is the tale of the Dorimare Fampyr: Lodewick the Fair tracks the Fampyr Lisbeta to the abandoned city of Dorimare, slaying her, only to succumb to his grievous wounds while he cradles the lifeless body of his friend, the golden-haired Brother Erwin.
                <br><br>Another famous Blade is Lady Adelaide, a princess turned highwoman. A cousin to the then-Petty King Petyr, she is most famous for her supposed alliance with the goblins living beneath Helmstadt. Together, they defeated the lich-king of the Roads Below, only for Adelaide to be betrayed by her goblin compatriots over something as slight as a misspoken promise.</p>
                <p class="subtitle wrapper">Becoming a Blade</p>
                <p class="text paragraph">This is a secret well-kept. The rite is said to involve magic, and certainly it must, for Blades carry that taint without exception. Yet the details are not known to any but the Blades themselves, for they speak not of its intimates to any who are not likewise inducted. The only known route to Bladehood is to be apprenticed by a veteran Blade, and they are elusive at the best of times.</p>
                <p class="text">The Guild of Songstresses know a little of the specifics, familiar as they themselves are with Trickery. Hidden away in their great vault in Redstone they hold a singular written copy of the Oath sworn by all aspirant Blades.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <p class="text">Below is the transcript of the Oath, as collected by Songstress Gerdien of Lange Meer in 407pR:</p>
                <p class="poem">"I hereby swear to become a Blade. Wherever possible, I will take up arms against the instruments of Reaping, to safeguard merriment, magic, and the places they dwell. My patron of patrons is the Trickster, and her interests are mine also. Her many children&mdash;fairies great and small&mdash;are my wards but not my masters.<br>All Blades are my brethren. Never will I knowingly work against them. If ever I risk divulging our secrets, may my tongue be tied and the words stuck in my throat."</p>
                <p class="text">Given the wording of this Oath, it is unclear how Gerdien was able to transcribe its contents onto paper. And, more significantly, why the order of Blades has not intervened to destroy the copy since. Potentially, the text is false or has been significantly altered, or perhaps the Songstress' method of collection was so wily that it impressed the Trickster herself into tolerance. The few texts the Songstress Gerdien left behind after her disappearance in 423pR remain vague on these years of her life.</p>
                <p class="subtitle wrapper">Blade Purges</p>
                <p class="text">Finally, it should be noted that following the False Reaping of 410, the Justiciar church organised extensive purges of Sentinels and Blades across the provinces of Oswick, Hyperia, and the Marches, culminating in the Imperial Heartland's <em>Purgatio Sum</em> in 503pR. While the kingdom of Fallowmere has refrained from legal action against the two groups, public opinion of Blades and Sentinels alike is at an all-time low.</p>
